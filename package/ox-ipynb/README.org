#+TITLE: ox-ipynb --- Convert an org-file to an ipynb


This module allows you to export an org-file to an Ipython notebook. Python and R notebooks are currently supported. It is not currently possible to mix these languages.

* About this module

The Jupyter/Ipython notebooks are ultimately just json files. This module parses an org-file, and creates json files that represent them. The parsing is rudimentary. Jupyter notebooks only have two basic cells: text and code. This module tries to parse the org-file into those two kinds of cells.

See this example org-file: [[./example.org]] and the corresponding ipynb: [[./example.ipynb]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'ox-ipynb)
#+END_SRC

This will install a new export menu titled "Export to jupyter notebook" with three sub-options to export to a buffer, to a file, and to a file and open.

** Adding a new language

It is probably possible to add new languages  by adding to the variables =ox-ipynb-kernelspecs= and =ox-ipynb-language-infos=. These were reverse-engineered to make the json metadata. I do not know what the minimal setup for this is required and suggest adapting these variables by example.
